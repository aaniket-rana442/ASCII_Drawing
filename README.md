# ASCII_Drawing

## 📖 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to create an **ASCII-style image** of an assigned famous personality using **basic Python programming concepts** such as loops and conditional statements.

The project focuses on strengthening logical thinking, control flow, and understanding how patterns can be generated programmatically.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- To apply **core Python fundamentals**
- To understand **nested loops and conditional logic**
- To generate an **ASCII image using characters** like `*`, `.`, `#`, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Concepts Used:**
  - Loops (`for`, `while`)
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
  - Basic variables and logic

---

## ⚙️ How the Code Works
1. The program uses **nested loops** to iterate over rows and columns.
2. Each position in the output grid is checked using **if-else conditions**.
3. Based on the condition, a specific ASCII character is printed.
4. Together, these characters form an **ASCII representation of the personality image**.
5. The final output is displayed directly in the terminal/console.
